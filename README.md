A Linear Algebra and Machine Learning "Library" in C

---

# Why.....

Well, I'm currently doing my bachelors in AI&DS so it just appropriate that I try out
every machine learning algo I learn. And not just try these algorithms but also package
them in such a way that I can use these Algo's instead of third-party ones.

This package, even if I try for the next 10 years, will not be anywhere close to the the
third party packages. This is just a learning experience for me. This package is meant
to grow with me as I learn new Machine Learning Algo or anything similar

## Some goals

- All the algo will be written in C
- There will be compilation options to
  - Compile everything to a single shared object file.
  - Compile individual packages. eg just the Vec package, ML ..etc
- Have nice API's to interact with Python

### More docs. And usage instructions will be added soon.

## Bye...
